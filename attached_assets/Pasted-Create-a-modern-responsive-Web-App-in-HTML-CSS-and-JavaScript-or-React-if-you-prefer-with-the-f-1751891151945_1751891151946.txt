Create a modern, responsive Web App in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React if you prefer) with the following features:

1️⃣ A **questionnaire page** about digital pollution, containing at least 10 questions such as:
- "Do you regularly clean your email inbox?"
- "How often do you watch videos in 4K?"
- "Do you use cloud storage for photos and videos?"
- "Do you delete old files from your devices?"
- "How many unread emails do you have?"
- "Do you use AI tools like ChatGPT or Copilot daily?"
- "Do you archive documents you no longer need?"
- "Do you backup your data weekly?"
- "How often do you empty your recycle bin?"
- "Do you optimize your smartphone storage?"

2️⃣ A **progress bar** at the top or bottom of the page:
- The bar should be **green** if the answers show low digital pollution
- The bar should turn **red** if the answers show high pollution
- The progress bar updates dynamically after each answer

3️⃣ An **idea for a mini-game** to include or describe in the app:
- The mini-game is called "Server Clean-up"
- The player controls a digital agent that must **drag and drop floating icons (emails, videos, AI files) into the right bin**
- Each action reduces the pollution of a virtual planet shown on screen
- If the player deletes important data by mistake, the planet gets more polluted

4️⃣ A **results page** after the questionnaire:
- Displays an estimated score of digital pollution
- Shows equivalences in kg of CO2, kilometers driven, liters of water consumed
- Includes **personalized advice**

5️⃣ A **tips page** with floating bubbles or buttons, each showing **simple actions to reduce digital pollution**, for example:
- "Unsubscribe from newsletters you never read"
- "Clean your inbox weekly"
- "Avoid storing unnecessary files in the cloud"
- "Lower video streaming resolution"
- "Delete duplicate photos"
- "Empty your trash regularly"
- "Limit AI usage when not essential"

6️⃣ The design should be:
- Bright, modern, and clear
- Use green and red colors for clarity
- Mobile-friendly

7️⃣ Provide clear navigation between:
- Questionnaire
- Mini-game description or link
- Results
- Tips page

8️⃣ Add a **header with the project title**:
"Secret Data Waste: Clean Your Invisible Cloud!"

Make sure all texts are in English.
